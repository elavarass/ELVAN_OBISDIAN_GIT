# Typing Speed[]

The purpose of acquiring a good typing method is to learn to type quickly and efficiently. Speed is therefore the ultimate goal of the training. The best way to reach this goal is with a [good typing method](https://www.typingpal.com/en/documentation/school-edition/pedagogical-resources/typing-method).

## What Speed Target Should I Aim For?[](https://www.typingpal.com/en/documentation/school-edition/pedagogical-resources/typing-speed#what-speed-target-should-i-aim-for)

Although speed is measured objectively, its evaluation is much more subjective. What is a good target to aim for? It is difficult to say. Even the scientific literature is divided on the question.

The right speed target depends on your age and your end goal. Do you simply want to be more efficient in writing emails, or do you intend to compete in international competitions?

|Targets for an adult|Words per minute (wpm)|Characters per minute (cpm)|
|---|---|---|
|Average speed|40 wpm and over|200 cpm and over|
|Above average speed|50 wpm and over|250 cpm and over|
|Productive speed|60 wpm and over|300 cpm and over|
|High speed|70 wpm and over|350 cpm and over|
|Competitive speed|120 wpm and over|600 cpm and over|

**Did you know?** — According to [Intersteno](http://www.intersteno.org), an international federation that regularly organizes international typing contests, the world record for typing speed is held by Czech typist Helena Matoušková. In 2003, she achieved a typing speed of 955 characters per minute. That’s around 191 words per minute, with 99.97% precision!

### Final Target[](https://www.typingpal.com/en/documentation/school-edition/pedagogical-resources/typing-speed#final-target)

Typing Pal suggests setting a final target for the typing speed you want to reach by the end of the training. This target will vary according to your age and the skill level you are aiming for. Check out the table below to help you set an appropriate target.

|Age range|Beginner|Intermediate|Expert|
|---|---|---|---|
|6 to 11 years old|15 wpm  <br>(75 cpm)  <br>**80%** accuracy|25 wpm  <br>(125 cpm)  <br>**85%** accuracy|35 wpm  <br>(175 cpm)  <br>**90%** accuracy|
|12 to 16 years old|30 wpm  <br>(150 cpm)  <br>**85%** accuracy|40 wpm  <br>(200 cpm)  <br>**90%** accuracy|50 wpm  <br>(250 cpm)  <br>**95%** accuracy|
|17 years old and over|45 wpm  <br>(225 cpm)  <br>**90%** accuracy|55 wpm  <br>(275 cpm)  <br>**95%** accuracy|65 wpm  <br>(325 cpm)  <br>**100%** accuracy|

### Intermediate Targets[](https://www.typingpal.com/en/documentation/school-edition/pedagogical-resources/typing-speed#intermediate-targets)

Once you have set your final target, Typing Pal uses this to calculate intermediate targets for each of the training activities under the _Learning_ tab. These intermediate targets are adjusted to the difficulty coefficient for the text and its relative position in the training plan.

For example, if the final target is set at 65 words per minute, the speed target for the first exercise will be set at 33 words per minute. Achieving this reasonable goal with total accuracy is a prediction of the training program’s ultimate success.

### Speed Evaluation[](https://www.typingpal.com/en/documentation/school-edition/pedagogical-resources/typing-speed#speed-evaluation)

The typing speed recorded during exercises or tests at the end of each step under the _Learning_ tab is useful for formative evaluation. For example, this data allows you to compare student scores during the course of their training.

For a summative evaluation, we recommend that you refer instead to the final tests under the _Learning_ tab, or to the texts under the _Progress_ tab, since the texts used in these activities more closely reflect a real-life context. Filter the statistics by selecting this activity type. This will show more accurate results in terms of the performance level achieved.

Finally, to evaluate progress, we recommend that you compare the initial test result with the final test result. Since the two tests are exactly the same, you will get a clear indication of progress.
