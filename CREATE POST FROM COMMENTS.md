Jasmin Alić states that **90% of his post ideas come directly from comments, a method he attributes to having written over 6,000 LinkedIn posts**. This demonstrates the profound impact that engaging with the comment section has had on his content output and strategy.

In the larger context of "Source of Ideas," the sources highlight that comments are not merely feedback but a rich, ongoing wellspring for new content, making the process of generating ideas systematic and efficient:

- **A "Goldmine" of Insights**: Comments are consistently described as a "goldmine" for content ideas. They offer "real questions and pain points", providing "unfiltered and incredibly insightful" feedback. This is akin to having a "free focus group" or "instant market research" at one's fingertips, revealing "what people really care about" and "what people actually want to know".
- **Methodology for Volume**: Jasmin Alić's process for generating content involves a simple, repeatable daily habit:
    1. **Find a highly engaged post**.
    2. **Scroll through its comments for about two minutes**.
    3. **Identify good questions posed by others**.
    4. **Answer one of these questions in the next post**. This routine makes content creation "practically write itself", turning "curiosity into a content engine" and enabling a continuous flow of posts.
- **Eliminating Content Anxiety and Guesswork**: A significant advantage of this approach is the alleviation of common creative struggles. Creators no longer have to "worry about what your next post will be" or be "staring at the screen wondering what to post". This strategy "turns writer’s block into a research tool" and helps creators "stop guessing and start listening". It allows creators to "spot it where others scroll past" and directly address audience needs without overthinking.
- **Ensuring Relevance and Engagement**: By directly responding to audience questions and pain points discovered in comments, the resulting posts are "relevant and audience-focused" and "keep the content fresh". Elizabeth Houston highlights that this is a powerful form of "social listening and crowdsourcing" that provides "a front row seat to pain points happening in real-time". This direct engagement ensures "more targeted messaging" and leads to increased "engagement + connection". Leon Gordon succinctly puts it: "**Listening is content strategy**". Jasmin Alić himself reinforces this, stating it's "100% about listening, not content".
- **Efficiency and Strategic Laziness**: The method is described as a "simple move", "smart and practical", and a "strategically lazy approach". It's about turning "scrolling into inspiration and intention" and ensures that creators consistently "add value".
- **Potential Challenges**: While highly effective, some contributors acknowledge nuances. Tara Wagner notes that sometimes comment threads are filled with generic agreements, requiring deeper scrolling to find truly insightful comments. Hezron Ochiel also asks how to extract meaningful content from generic or AI-generated comments. Akshay Wasnik raises the point that going through each comment might be time-consuming.

In essence, Jasmin Alić's ability to create 6,000+ LinkedIn posts stems from transforming the comment section into a dynamic, real-time "research lab" and a strategic content engine. This consistent, audience-driven approach provides a clear direction for content, vastly reducing the guesswork and anxiety associated with content creation, thereby facilitating high volume and sustained relevance.

The sources strongly emphasise that **finding good questions** within comments is a cornerstone of Jasmin Alić's highly prolific content creation strategy, specifically highlighting its significance within the **larger context of daily practice**.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about "finding good questions" as a daily practice:

- **The Core Method for Endless Content** Jasmin Alić explicitly states that **90% of his post ideas originate from comments**, and this method is how he has successfully written "6,000+ LinkedIn posts". This volume is directly attributed to the daily habit of finding and answering questions. The method is straightforward: "Find a post with very good engagement", then "Take 2 minutes to scroll the comments", and critically, "Find good questions others are asking". The simplicity of this daily loop – "scroll through the comments → answer with competence → draft a new post instantly" – is key to its effectiveness and consistent output. Chathura Meegama echoes this, noting that "Finding good questions others are asking in comments and answering them in your next post is a direct path to endless content ideas". Angela Brooks also affirms, "The best ideas come from amazing questions or just people answering".
    
- **Eliminating Content Anxiety and Writer's Block** One of the most significant benefits of this daily practice is that it **removes the common struggle of content creation**. By consistently looking for questions, creators "never-ever have to worry about what your next post will be" or be "staring at the screen wondering what to post". This shift means content "practically writes itself", turning "writer’s block into a research tool". It's about being "in tune with your audience - listen more", and "spotting it where others scroll past" instead of waiting for inspiration. As Bobby Joachim notes, this practice can lead to "ideas for posts and projects".
    
- **Ensuring Relevance and Audience Focus** The daily act of finding good questions ensures that content is **directly relevant to the audience's needs and interests**. Comments are repeatedly described as a "goldmine for real questions and pain points". They offer "unfiltered and incredibly insightful" feedback, functioning as a "free focus group" or "instant market research". This direct insight ensures that posts are "relevant and audience-focused" and provide "more targeted messaging". Several commentators confirm this, highlighting that this strategy helps to "stay in tune with your audience’s needs" and identify "what people really care about". As Leon Gordon succinctly puts it, "**Listening is content strategy**".
    
- **Efficiency and a "Strategically Lazy" Approach** The daily discipline of scrolling for questions is presented as an incredibly efficient strategy. Darren Mass describes it as "Such a simple move, but so underrated". Denise R. Green calls it a "Strategically Lazy approach". It's about "Turning curiosity into consistency, one scroll at a time", allowing creators to "stop guessing and start listening". The comments are seen as "the content beneath the content," where "the gold is hiding in plain sight". Many users, like Shezan Ahmed, find them "easy to create too". This consistent effort means creators "consistently add value" and can achieve "content on autopilot".
    
- **Acknowledging Nuances in Daily Question Finding** While the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, some comments highlight potential challenges in the daily practice of finding good questions. Tara Wagner notes that sometimes comment threads are filled with generic agreements, requiring deeper scrolling to "find those really insightful posts and comments to work from". Hezron Ochiel also raises the pertinent question of "how you extract meaningful content from comments like 'Great,' 'I love this,' or 'This is amazing' e.t.c, alongside those annoying, generic AI-generated ones". Akshay Wasnik points out that "going through each comment and reply to every comment" might be "time consuming". However, the general consensus is that the effort of persistent scrolling for genuine questions pays significant dividends.
    

In summary, the sources convey that "finding good questions" as a daily practice transforms content creation from a struggle into a systematic, efficient, and highly effective process, ensuring consistent, relevant, and engaging output on platforms like LinkedIn.

The sources extensively discuss the strategy of "Answer one question in your next post" as a central component of Jasmin Alić's highly effective content creation method on LinkedIn, deeply embedding it within the concept of a "Daily Practice".

**The Core Daily Practice: Answering a Comment Question**

Jasmin Alić explicitly states that **90% of his post ideas originate from comments**, and this systematic approach has enabled him to write **over 6,000 LinkedIn posts**. His method is straightforward and designed for daily implementation:

- **Find a highly engaged post**.
- **Spend two minutes scrolling through the comments**.
- **Identify relevant questions others are asking**.
- **Answer one of these questions in your next post**.

He confirms, "Literally, just scroll through the comments → answer with competence → draft a new post instantly" and reiterates, "**I do this every... single... day**". This highlights that "answering one question in your next post" is not a sporadic act but a consistent, habitual discipline.

**Impact of this Daily Practice on Content Generation:**

This daily commitment to answering audience questions from comments yields several significant benefits:

- **Eliminates Content Anxiety and Writer's Block**: By making this a daily habit, creators "never-ever have to worry about what your next post will be". As Jasmin Alić's comment to Chathura Meegama affirms, it's about "never worrying about where your next post comes from". Commentators like Ghufran Hasan note that it means "No more staring at the screen wondering what to post", and Neil Shapiro describes it as turning "writer’s block into a research tool".
- **Ensures Continuous and Relevant Content Flow**: This practice is seen as a "direct path to endless content ideas", making content "practically write itself", and functioning as "content on autopilot". Ricky Waters points out that it "keeps the content fresh", a sentiment Jasmin Alić agrees with. Joost Toornend adds that it ensures content remains "relevant and focused on what people actually want to know".
- **Deepens Audience Understanding ("Listening is Content Strategy")**: The fundamental principle behind this daily practice is **listening**. Jasmin Alić clarifies, this is "100% about listening, not content". Leon Gordon eloquently states, "**Listening is content strategy**". This approach allows creators to be "in tune with your audience", providing "a front row seat to pain points happening in real-time" and revealing "what people really care about". As Ksenia Votinova-Arnaud puts it, "This is called focusing on customers first. 😉 First, you find the demand, then you provide the solution".
- **Efficiency and Strategic Laziness**: Many perceive this method as incredibly efficient and intelligent. Darren Mass calls it "Such a simple move, but so underrated". Denise R. Green appreciates it as a "Strategically Lazy approach". It's about turning "curiosity into a content engine" and transforming "scrolling into inspiration and intention".
- **Crowdsourced Market Research**: Several contributors equate this daily practice to a form of real-time market research or a focus group. Elizabeth Houston describes it as "social listening and crowdsourcing that's so powerful", while E-Baithak Consulting notes, "The comments are like a free focus group - unfiltered and incredibly insightful". Mia Yu even states, "Comments = instant market research". This daily engagement provides "free insights just waiting to be turned into meaningful content".
- **Builds Connection and Community**: Beyond just ideas, this method fosters engagement. Answering questions in posts "show that I am truly listening", strengthening connection. Jasmin Alić also offers a "Pro tip: Thank the people who inspire your posts", which Bakhtawar Ahmed praises for keeping "the community spirit alive".

**Nuances and Considerations for Daily Practice:**

While widely praised, some challenges with this daily practice are also acknowledged:

- **Finding Quality Comments**: Tara Wagner notes that some comment threads are filled with generic agreements, making it difficult to find truly insightful questions. Jasmin Alić's advice is simply to "scroll further!". Hezron Ochiel also asks how to "extract meaningful content from comments like 'Great,' 'I love this,' or 'This is amazing' e.t.c, alongside those annoying, generic AI-generated ones".
- **Time Management**: Akshay Wasnik raises the concern that "this is time consuming, going through each comment and reply to every comment". However, Jasmin Alić's initial instruction specifies "Take 2 minutes to scroll the comments", suggesting it's a quick daily scan, not an exhaustive analysis.

In summary, the daily practice of answering one question from comments transforms content creation from a struggle for inspiration into a streamlined, audience-driven process. It ensures relevance, reduces anxiety, and enables a consistent, high volume of valuable LinkedIn posts, as evidenced by Jasmin Alić's 6,000+ posts.

The concept of "**draft a new post instantly**" is a cornerstone of Jasmin Alić's content creation methodology, deeply embedded within his daily practice and the broader context of his process. It signifies a profound shift in how content ideas are generated and executed, moving away from traditional brainstorming towards a highly responsive and efficient system.

Here's what the sources say about "draft a new post instantly" in the larger context of the process:

- **A Streamlined, Daily Workflow**: Jasmin Alić outlines his precise daily ritual: "Literally, just scroll through the comments → answer with competence → **draft a new post instantly**". He emphasizes that he does this "every... single... day", indicating that the "instant drafting" is not a sporadic act but a continuous, integrated part of his routine. This systematic approach is directly credited with enabling him to produce "6,000+ LinkedIn posts".
- **Eliminating Content Anxiety and Writer's Block**: The ability to "draft a new post instantly" fundamentally addresses the common challenges of content creation. By consistently finding "good questions others are asking", creators "never-ever have to worry about what your next post will be". This eliminates the need for "staring at the screen wondering what to post" and effectively "turns writer’s block into a research tool". It allows for "content on autopilot", as the direction for the next post is readily available from the audience itself.
- **Direct Audience-Driven Relevance**: The "instant" nature of drafting is possible because the content is a direct response to genuine audience inquiries. Comments are repeatedly described as a "goldmine for real questions and pain points", providing "unfiltered and incredibly insightful" feedback. This means the posts are inherently "relevant and audience-focused" and ensure "more targeted messaging". When you're answering a direct question, the framework for the post is largely pre-defined, allowing for quick formulation.
- **Shifting from Creator to Listener**: The capacity for instant drafting emerges from a strategic mindset shift. Instead of brainstorming ideas in a vacuum, creators are encouraged to become "listeners". As Komal Sinha notes, it's "not about waiting for inspiration. It’s about spotting it where others scroll past". This proactive engagement with comments, identifying unspoken needs or explicit questions, provides the immediate trigger for drafting.
- **Efficiency and Strategic Value**: The process is deemed "simple yet powerful" and a "strategically lazy approach" because it leverages existing audience interactions for maximum efficiency. It turns "scrolling into inspiration and intention", making the content creation process highly productive without requiring significant upfront ideation. The insights are "already there, we have to tune in", making the drafting quick because the core idea is already validated.
- **Challenges and Nuances**: While the general sentiment is that this method facilitates instant drafting, some commentators acknowledge that finding truly insightful questions can take effort amidst generic or AI-generated comments. However, Jasmin Alić's response, "Well… scroll further! Haha", suggests that persistence within the daily practice will yield the necessary "good questions" to enable continuous, instant content generation.

In essence, "draft a new post instantly" encapsulates the culmination of Jasmin Alić's method: a highly efficient, audience-centric process that leverages daily "social listening" to transform genuine audience curiosity into readily actionable and relevant content ideas, thereby making the actual drafting of posts almost automatic and stress-free.

The sources strongly indicate that a significant benefit of Jasmin Alić's daily content creation practice, particularly the strategy of finding and answering questions from comments, is that it **keeps content fresh**. This freshness is a direct outcome of the method's inherent focus on real-time audience engagement and pain points.

Here's what the sources say about how this approach keeps content fresh, within the larger context of its benefits:

*   **Directly Stated as a Benefit**: Ricky Waters explicitly states that using comments for new post ideas "is smart and keeps the content fresh". Jasmin Alić concurs, responding to Ricky, "Yesss! I used the word 'fresh' too to describe this :)". This highlights that 'freshness' is a recognised and intended outcome of the strategy.
*   **Preventing Repetition and Staying Relevant**: The daily practice of "scrolling through the comments → answer with competence → draft a new post instantly" ensures that content is continually derived from new, audience-driven input. This stands in contrast to guessing content angles, which can lead to repetitive or outdated topics. Gabriel Ageron Dit Blanc notes that this trick, used daily for managing brand accounts, helps to "avoid sounding repetitive or out of touch". The comments, acting as a "free focus group - unfiltered and incredibly insightful", provide real-time pain points and perspectives, ensuring that the content created in response is inherently relevant to current audience needs.
*   **Eliminating Content Block and Generating Endless Ideas**: The core mechanism of drawing ideas from comments, which Jasmin Alić credits for 90% of his 6,000+ LinkedIn posts, inherently ensures a continuous flow of new topics. This directly tackles "writer's block" and the struggle of "staring at the screen wondering what to post". Chathura Meegama describes it as a "direct path to endless content ideas", meaning there's always something new to discuss, thus keeping the content stream fresh. Abdul Rehman further supports this, stating it's "the easiest way to never run out of ideas". The practice of "turning curiosity into consistency, one scroll at a time" means new ideas are constantly being "mined" from "gold mines" of comments.
*   **Promoting Listening and Responsiveness**: The freshness stems from the fact that the creator is constantly "listening" to their audience. As Leon Gordon states, "**Listening is content strategy**". This responsiveness to what people are "actually asking" or "what people really care about" means the content dynamically adapts to audience interests, maintaining its novelty and relevance. This ensures that the content is not static but rather evolves with the audience's needs, contributing to its ongoing freshness.
*   **Efficiency in Idea Generation**: The method is described as "simple and smart", "brilliant", and even "strategically lazy". This efficiency in identifying relevant questions ensures that the process of generating new, fresh content ideas is streamlined and sustainable daily.

- **Overcoming Writer's Block and Guesswork**: A significant benefit is the complete eradication of creative anxiety. Ghufran Hasan notes, "No more staring at the screen wondering what to post". Neil Shapiro adds that it "turns writer’s block into a research tool". This frees creators from guessing what their audience wants, instead empowering them to "stop guessing and start listening". As Khadija Iftikhar puts it, real creators think "not 'what should I say?' but 'what are people already asking?'".
- **Efficiency and Strategic Listening**: The daily practice of reviewing comments transforms content ideation into an efficient and "strategically lazy approach". It's about "spotting it where others scroll past" and "turning curiosity into a content engine". By consistently tuning into audience questions, creators ensure their content is always "relevant and audience-focused" and "keeps the content fresh". This deep listening is key, as Jasmin Alić asserts, "this is 100% about listening, not content".
- **Audience-Driven Relevance**: Since ideas are drawn directly from audience questions and pain points, the resulting posts are inherently valuable and resonate strongly. Comments are described as a "goldmine for real questions and pain points" and a "free focus group - unfiltered and incredibly insightful". This ensures "more targeted messaging" and leads to increased "engagement + connection".
- **Reduced Effort for High Volume**: The consistent nature of this daily habit facilitates high-volume content creation with less effort. Shubhangi Madan highlights that with this method, the "audience writes half the post for you". It becomes "content on autopilot".

This consistent, audience-informed process inherently contributes to a state of **calm clarity** regarding content strategy.
