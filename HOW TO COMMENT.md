Based on the sources and our conversation history, here's how you can approach writing effective comments on LinkedIn:

- **Be Engaging and Show Appreciation:** Many comments across the sources express positive sentiments like "Awesome product," "Looks great," "Love it," "This is great," and "Impressive". While these are simple, they show engagement with the post.
    
- **Add Value and Insight:** Comments that offer relevant insights or build upon the original post tend to be well-received. For example, on Lara Acosta's post, Kristo Olli comments, "it's better to start with something instead of not logging in at all", adding a practical takeaway. Similarly, on Justin Welsh's post about consistency, a comment notes, "Consistency over shortcuts such a powerful message. The Creator MBA sounds like a game changer for entrepreneurs", showing understanding and appreciation of the content.
    
- **Share Your Agreement or Relatability:** Comments that express agreement or share a personal connection with the post can foster interaction. On Charles Miller's post about curiosity, someone says, "Nobody can beat the person who stays curious. It's the ultimate hack to enjoying life and work. Charles Miller," and another replies, "Absolutely love this message about balance between confidence and humility! It's so important in all aspects of life. Charles Miller".
    
- **Ask Thought-Provoking Questions:** Asking questions can encourage further discussion and position you as someone who is actively thinking about the topic. For instance, someone asks Sam Szuchan, "what will be your advice for students?". Similarly, on Matt Barker's post, someone inquires, "Why do you want to retire?".
    
- **Offer Practical Tips or Suggestions:** If you have relevant advice or suggestions related to the post's topic, sharing them can be valuable. On Matt Barker's post about hook writing, various users share how they intend to use the templates.
    
- **Keep it Concise and Relevant:** While adding value is important, ensure your comments are focused and directly related to the content of the post.
    
- **Be Authentic:** Jasmin Alić emphasizes the importance of "always keep it real". Writing genuine comments that reflect your true thoughts and reactions can help you build more meaningful connections.
    
- **Dedicate Time for Commenting:** As mentioned in our previous conversation and by Jasmin Alić, **prioritising time for commenting daily** can be a valuable strategy for networking and increasing visibility . She even suggests taking **15 minutes in the morning** to comment.
    
- **Engage with Others' Comments:** Replying to comments on a post, including your own, can further the conversation and show that you are actively participating. Matt Barker frequently replies to comments on his posts.
    
- **Avoid Generic Comments:** Try to go beyond simple one-word responses like "Interesting" or "Great advice," although these can still show initial engagement. Aim to elaborate slightly or connect the post to your own experiences or insights where appropriate.
    

By focusing on adding value, being authentic, and engaging thoughtfully with the content and other commenters, you can write effective comments that help you build your network and establish authority on LinkedIn.
